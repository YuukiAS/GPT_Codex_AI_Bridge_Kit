# Changelog

## 0.5.0

- Add Reviewed Handoff as a bounded middle workflow between Lite Handoff and high-risk Agent-Flow.
- Add GPT Planner -> Codex Executor -> Scheduled GPT Reviewer lifecycle with at most two review rounds and one scheduled Plan revision before human escalation.
- Add `ai-bridge reviewed-handoff ...` routing through a compatibility wrapper while preserving existing CLI implementation paths.
- Add a lightweight local Codex watcher for zero-touch `PLAN_FROZEN` / `REVISE` execution, with machine-local state, fast-forward-only branch sync, bounded retries, real state-progress detection, and visible operational blocking instead of endless retry loops.
- Add machine-validated Plan, Result, Review, CI-readiness, review-limit, and all-terminal final-report gates without importing Agent-Flow Requirement Ledger, Stable Review Snapshot, receipt graphs, or provenance hash chains.
- Add a Scheduled Task prompt that uses ChatGPT Automations plus GitHub-tracked `CURRENT.json` state instead of OpenAI API calls.
- Stabilize Reviewed Handoff CI authority and watcher publication semantics: CI-required execution now routes through `WAITING_FOR_CI`, `CURRENT.ci_status` is the single CI machine truth, Scheduled GPT uses the published branch tip as the real GitHub checks locator, and Executor publication remains watcher-owned.

## 0.4.0

- Add Optional Agent-Flow Core with Project Profile installation, task
  initialization, Requirement Ledger validation, canonical implementation and
  verifier source manifests, Stable Review Snapshot, Review Bundle validation,
  deterministic change classification, typed finding routing, Final Critic
  gate checks, detached worktree planning, and terminal notification brief
  generation for existing Generic Notifier.
- Add `ai-bridge agent-flow ...` CLI commands while keeping Lite Handoff, Host
  Policy, Private Bootstrap, and Generic Notifier backward compatible.
- Convert CARE Agent-Flow lessons into generic regression and portability tests
  without requiring CARE, GPU, Slurm, medical data, fixed branches, private
  paths, or external services.
- Tighten Agent-Flow lifecycle validation with fail-closed state predicates,
  bound Final Critic artifacts, role/session authority checks, multi-change
  invalidation, heavy Verifier rerun guards, terminal brief generation, and CI.
- Close Agent-Flow state-machine authority gaps with a schema-backed transition
  graph, task nonce envelope validation, required evidence file/SHA checks,
  unified current findings, mandatory Final Critic audit checks, and real Toy
  A/B E2E repair lifecycle tests.
- Close final v0.4.0 release blockers for stale semantic snapshots, explicit
  contract-review refreeze gates, role commit provenance, evidence artifact
  semantic binding, single current findings truth, machine review write
  authority, and runtime role receipt predicates.
- Close final provenance blockers by binding semantic snapshots to current
  frozen contract and Requirement Ledger hashes, requiring contract-review
  refreeze to produce a new semantic target before runtime repair resumes, and
  making production transition predicates reject `fake-test` role receipts.

## 0.3.1

- Change Generic Notifier email subjects and bodies to Chinese-first narrative
  by default while preserving technical literals such as task keys, file paths,
  branch names, and commit/push status values.

## 0.3.0

- Add Generic Notifier with one-shot terminal brief sends, optional polling,
  local dedup/retry state, dry-run, and Gmail SMTP STARTTLS email.
- Add pull-only private notifier config sync from an existing rclone source.
- Add public notifier/private templates and shared Codex config profile docs.
- Keep Lite Handoff backward compatible.
- Keep Agent-Flow v3 as design-only TODO pending CARE closure.
- Record redacted real Gmail notifier E2E receipt in
  `docs/releases/0.3.0_notifier_e2e_redacted.json`.
